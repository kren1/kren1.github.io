Greetings.

![Greetings](http://www.fluentu.com/spanish/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/spanish-greetings6.jpg)

I'm Timotej or Tim for short. I live in centralish London where I study computing at Imperial College London.  

## I enjoy

### Discussions

From establishing if a door can be a curtain to economic policy I enjoy all sorts of meaningful and (less) meaningful discussions and/or arguments.  

### Logic, maths and programming

*I love programming. I admire the purity of Haskell while still searching for an appropriate application. I respect the honesty, age and simplicity of C. I marvel at verbosity of Java and exploit the libraries of Python. I applaud the implementers of Prolog, bow to VHDL designers and pay my respects to Fortran.*

{% highlight python %}
import answer
answer.run()
{% endhighlight %}

I would describe myself as a minimalist programmer. I try not to write code if it has been written before. Googling for answers, copying small snippets from Stack Overflow and searching for programs that do the heavy lifting are my tools of choice. I'm always disappointed when I find it easier to re-implement a well known algorithm due to a lack of appropriate libraries. Writing the best libraries is in itself an interesting problem albeit mostly solved one.

Applying logic and maths to programming always feels like a virtuous pursuit. The confidence gained from trying to prove a piece of code with logic is unparalleled! And finallty to complete the heading, maths, the one the rule them all. While not being as well trained in it's dark magics as I would like to be, I still enjoy a good piece of mathematical machinery.

### "Efficiently" spending time

Watching a silly tv show with a glass of G&T while discussing the difference between a hall, hallway and a landing could be described as my favorite pass time.

## I enjoy less

### Web development

I find web development boring. The setup and initial toying around is fun.
Going beyond that usually just results in spending an afternoon trying to make two
buttons align.
